Create image ghosts of bright stars

Note that some files in this repository are tracked using git-lfs. To successfully clone and use this repository, you will need git-lfs. See our [Developer Guide](http://developer.lsst.io/en/latest/tools/git_lfs.html) for a explanation of how to set up Git LFS for LSST.

The ghosting data files, in ghost_data, illustrate how the light from a bright star at a given distance from the center of the boresight would scatter into the LSST focal plane. The original .fits files were named Ghost\_X.XX.fits where X.XX indicated the angle from the boresight in degrees, and moved in steps of 0.02 degrees. The translated .txt files multiply X.XX by 50, to give integer steps, resulting in the LSST\_Ghost\_Y.txt filenames. These ghosting data files were generated by Chuck Claver, using LSST Ver 3.3 Baseline Design (and ZMAX), in 2/2013.
